# High Performance Seismic Stacking

This projects aims to provide a high performance implementation for Seismic Stack computing method with support to three diferent traveltime models:

* Common Mid Point
* Zero Offset Common Reflection Surface
* Offset Continuation Trajectory

It's provided an implementation for both CUDA and OpenCL (in development) frameworks.

An implementation to get rid of stretch behavior is also available.

## Running

To further information on how to run the implementations of this project, refer to `cuda/` or `opencl/` according to your needs.
